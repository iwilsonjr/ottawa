      <h1>Procedure</h1>

      <p>During the course of testing, I developed a consistent process that I used to create each model or mapping. This process, as time went on, could be broken down to a number of steps.<p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>Determing the number of distinct views/screen/pages</li>
          <li>Collect code and determine patterns – which block/scripts get used through the site and which ones get used in certain views</li>
          <li>Map/Sketch the system with all its views</li>
      </ol>
      
      
      <p>One thing that grew out of this was a set of probe questions. These questions, in turn, garnered information to build each model as accurately as possible.<p>
      	
      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              How many views (distinct templates) do you have?
              <br/><em>Building system view</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are you the only source of content? If not, what the sources? 
              <br/><em>Information – internal/external sources</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are you the only source of HTML?
              <br/><em>Semantic – What is the source of HTML, internal/external</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many stylesheets in your site?
              <br/><em>Presentation</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Which ones are the main/commonly used? Which ones are page/view specific?
              <br/><em>Presentation – determining main block/fragments</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How dependent are the stylesheets on media queries? [Original Question - Which ones are dependent on CSS queries?] What do they query (device, conditions, etc.)?
              <br/><em>Presentation – determining which type of CSS blocks/fragments</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Do you use a JavaScript framework (jQuery/Mootools/Dojo)?
              <br/><em>Behavioral – determing the base, not extensions</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many plugins? How many are JavasScript only (non-framework related)? How many are related to framework?
              <br/><em>Behavioral – determing number of plugins/extensions, manner of plugins/extension</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many of these plugins have their own associated CSS file?
              <br/><em>Presentation (fragments)/Behavioral (relationships)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many of these plugins inject their own HTML (not just class changes but their own code)?
              <br/><em>Semantic (fragments)/Behavioral (relationships)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many scripts that are user-written? Are they dependent on a framework (not plugin/extending framework)?
              <br/><em>Behavioral (fragments), determining relationship between plugin/dependent scripts</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Any of these scripts inline (not external files)? How many?
              <br/><em>Behavioral (inline code)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              How many of these (JS) scripts are not local (external server)?
              <br/><em>Behavioral (external code)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are there any CSS that are on external servers?
              <br/><em>Presentation (external code)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are there any HTML that is taken from an external source? [Obsolete question?]
              <br/><em>Semantic (external code)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Does any of the scripts load other scripts?
              <br/><em>Behavioral (representing combined scripts)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are any of these scripts a combination of multiple JS scrips/files?
              <br/><em>Behavioral (representing combined scripts)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Does your site use some sort of framework other than jQuery, etc.? What are they? Are they extensions of any JS framework (jQuery, Dojo, etc.)?
              <br/><em>Behavioral/Framework relationship</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              From above, does this framework has related CSS? Does it inject its own HTML?
              <br/><em>Presentation/Semantic/Framework relationship - framework may contain other parts that must be accounted for in other layers and their relationship with the framework and the larger system/site</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Are there external sources of content via AJAX?
              <br/><em>Information, extended to Semantic as well</em>
          </li>
      </ol>
